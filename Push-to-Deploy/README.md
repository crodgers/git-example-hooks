Git pre-receive hooks
=====================

Most of the hooks here do **Push-to-Deploy**: Perform some for of Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment before a Git commit gets successfully pushed.

Some scripts are for pure **Git** repositories (and should work also on a Git bare repository), some are for **Gerrit** repositories, some for other Git repositories may come.
